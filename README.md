#### An organizational repo for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment


We're trying to getting folks organized on github for the Moore-Sloan initiative. Currently, there is some useful information in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/msdse/org/issues), and the [wiki](https://github.com/msdse/org/wiki). (Note that both of those are available as tabs on the right.)

Note that we have a [dashboard repository](https://github.com/msdse/dashboard) that will be used to track / display activity that the MSDSE group is engaging in.
